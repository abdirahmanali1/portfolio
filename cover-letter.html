                            DevOps, and system administration, I bring both technical expertise and problem-solving
                            skills that align with Google’s mission of delivering reliable and scalable cloud solutions.

                            In my current role as an <em>Infrastructure Technician</em> at EOS IT Solutions, I manage
                            the full hardware lifecycle, troubleshoot complex data center issues, and coordinate
                            upgrades with cross-functional teams to ensure <strong>uptime and operational
                                efficiency</strong>. Previously, at Merciful Hands Healthcare, I administered Active

                            enterprise-scale IT operations.

                            Beyond professional roles, I have completed a <strong>B.S. in Cloud Computing at Western

                            development skills. My experience spans <span class="tech-highlight">Google Cloud Platform,
